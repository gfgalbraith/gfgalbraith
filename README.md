### Hi, I'm Gemma 👋

I'm a **Marine Ecologist** broadly interested in **community ecology** and **connectivity** . My work often focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of marine ecosystems, particularly reef fish biodiversity and how environmental factors influence these communities. 🌊🐠

I'm a **fish nerd** and enjoy being in the field but i'm always keen to combine my ecology perspectuve with learning new skills in **data science**. 
Currently wokring at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.

### What I'm currently working on:
- Exploring deep **mesophotic coral ecosystems** using ROVs
- Quantifying biodiversity patterns and processes from distinct coral reef geomorphologies like **seamounts**
- Longterm **ecological monitoring** of coral reeefs and their resilience to environmental change 🐟
- Assessing patterns and processes in ecological **connectivity** incorporating genetics, hydrodynamics and biogeography
- Developing skills in **R** for data visualization and analysis 📈

### What I enjoy:
- Reef fish biodiversity data
- Building models and visualizations that heklp make sense of complex ecological patterns
- Learning new tools and techniques in data science
