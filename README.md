I'm a **Marine Ecologist** broadly interested in **community ecology** and **connectivity** . My work often focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of marine ecosystems, particularly reef fish biodiversity and how environmental factors influence these communities. 🌊🐠

I'm a **fish nerd** and enjoy being in the field but I'm always keen to combine my ecology interests with learning new skills in **data science**. 
Currently wokring at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia. 🇦🇺🦘

### What I'm currently working on:
- Exploring deep **mesophotic coral ecosystems** using ROVs 🎮🕹️🐠
- Quantifying biodiversity patterns and processes from distinct coral reef geomorphologies like **seamounts** 🌊🏔️
- Longterm **ecological monitoring** of coral reeefs and their resilience to environmental change 🐟🐠🐡
- Assessing patterns and processes in ecological **connectivity** incorporating genetics, hydrodynamics and biogeography 🧬🌊🌍
- Developing skills in **R** for data visualization, analysis and reproducible research 📈📊

### What I enjoy:
- Reef fish biodiversity data
- Building models and visualizations that help make sense of complex ecological patterns
- Learning new tools and techniques in data science
